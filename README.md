# 👋 Hey, I'm Naveen **Senior Software Engineer **  

*Designing scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure with precision.*
---
Experienced Senior Software Engineer (DevOps) with 5+ years of total IT experience, including 3 years in DevOps, specializing in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

My journey into DevOps began with a curiosity about how small pieces of infrastructure come together to power large-scale systems. Before transitioning fully into DevOps, I developed dynamic web applications and CRM solutions using PHP and MySQL, which gave me a strong foundation in backend development, problem-solving and system design.

Over the past few years, I’ve built and automated cloud-native environments on AWS, streamlined CI/CD pipelines and containerized applications to simplify and accelerate deployments. Along the way, I discovered a deep passion for DevSecOps — integrating security, automation and observability into every stage of the delivery lifecycle.

Skilled in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Helm and ArgoCD, I have a proven record of building secure, scalable and automated deployment pipelines that support high-availability systems.

Since November 2024, I have been on a planned career break for family responsibilities while continuing to upskill. During this period, I’ve been:

 🧠 Preparing for the **AWS SAA** certification  
 🏗️ Building **reusable Terraform modules** for infrastructure automation  
 🚀 Exploring **GitOps workflows** and **advanced CI/CD design patterns**  

I'm now actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to cloud-native, automation-driven teams and deliver meaningful infrastructure outcomes.
