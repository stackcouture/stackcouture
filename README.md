# 👋 Hi, I'm Naveen  🚀 **Senior Software Engineer**  

*Designing scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure with precision.*

---

I'm an experienced **Senior Software Engineer** with over **5 years in the IT industry**, including **4+ years of hands-on DevOps experience**. I began my career as a **Full Stack PHP Developer**, which gave me a strong foundation in software engineering principles and end-to-end delivery.

Over time, I transitioned into **DevOps**, where I took full ownership of infrastructure automation — focusing on **cloud-native development**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **infrastructure as code**. My toolset includes **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, **Jenkins**, and **Docker**.

Since **November 2024**, I've taken a career break due to **family responsibilities and personal commitments**. During this time, I’ve continued upskilling — preparing for the **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)** certification, developing reusable **Terraform modules**, and exploring **GitOps workflows**.

I'm now actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to cloud-native, automation-driven teams and deliver meaningful infrastructure outcomes.
