# 👋 Hey, I'm Naveen  
---
AWS DevOps Engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience and 5+ years in IT, specializing in CI/CD pipeline design, cloud infrastructure automation with Terraform and secure AWS deployments. Skilled in Docker, Kubernetes, GitOps (ArgoCD), Helm and security compliance

My journey into DevOps began with a curiosity about how individual infrastructure components come together to power reliable, large-scale systems. Prior to transitioning fully into DevOps, I worked on backend and full-stack development, building dynamic web applications and CRM solutions using PHP and MySQL. This background strengthened my understanding of application architecture, debugging, and system-level problem solving—skills that continue to influence how I design and operate infrastructure today.

In recent years, I have designed and automated cloud-native environments on AWS, built and optimized CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications to enable faster, more reliable deployments. I’ve developed a strong interest in DevSecOps, focusing on embedding security, automation, and observability throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

I am skilled in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Helm, and ArgoCD, with hands-on experience building secure, scalable, and highly automated deployment pipelines that support high-availability systems.

Since November 2024, I have been on a planned career break for family responsibilities while continuing to upskill. During this period, I:
* Completed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA) certification
* Built and documented hands-on DevOps, cloud, and GitOps projects, shared on my GitHub profile, covering AWS, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes and DevSecOps practices

I’m now actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute as a DevOps / Platform Engineer, helping teams build resilient, secure, and automation-driven cloud systems.
